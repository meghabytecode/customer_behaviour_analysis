# customer_behaviour_analysis
Data analysis projects showcasing customer behavior using Python, SQL and  Power BI


## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, focusing on **customer shopping behaviour**. The goal is to extract insights from customer purchase patterns and create interactive visualizations for better decision-making. The project is designed to be simple and clear.

## Dataset

**Dataset Name:** `Customer Shopping Behaviour`
The dataset contains customer purchase data including items bought, purchase frequency, spending patterns, and other behavioural details. It is loaded and analyzed using Python.

## Tools

* **Python** – For data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* **MySQL** – For querying and transforming the data
* **Power BI** – For creating interactive dashboards

## Steps

1. Load the `Customer Shopping Behaviour` dataset into Python.
2. Perform EDA to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies in customer behaviour.
3. Clean the data: handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
4. Run SQL queries to extract insights and aggregate important metrics.
5. Build a Power BI dashboard to visualize customer trends and patterns.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights key customer insights, including top products, purchasing trends, and segmentation analysis. It is designed to be interactive and easy to explore.

## Results

* Identified key shopping patterns and trends among customers
* Generated visualizations to support data-driven decisions
